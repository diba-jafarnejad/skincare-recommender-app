- Google Colab and VS Code for development

- Custom Feature Engineering: ingredient parsing, function tag matching, relevance scoring

## Datasets
This project uses and references the following skincare and beauty datasets:

- [INCI Dataset on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yavuzyilmaz/cosmetic-ingredients)  
  A science-backed skincare ingredient database offering detailed explanations of ingredient purposes and effects.

- [Sephora Products and Skincare Reviews dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nadyinky/sephora-products-and-skincare-reviews)
